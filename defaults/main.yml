### Managing files and directories.
## Minimum required values: 'type', 'state' and 'dest'
##
## For better maintainability, the file list is built during runtime by
## combining all lists together. This will provide the freedom of declaring
## custom file lists for granular control. The lists require a naming
## convention by using a pattern. The pattern is rendered as a single list
## which can be used for iteration with variable: 'role_file_manager_file_list'
## The list name pattern needs to start with: 'role_file_manager_file_list_'

role_file_manager_file_list_default: []

## Example:
# role_file_manager_file_list_some_stuff:
#   - type: directory
#     state: absent
#     dest: /tmp/example.dir.tmp
#     owner: root
#     group: root
#     mode: '0755'
#   - type: file
#     state: present
#     src: example.file
#     dest: /tmp/example.file.tmp
#     owner: root
#     group: root
#     mode: '0644'
#   - type: template
#     state: present
#     src: example.template.j2
#     dest: /etc/motd
#     owner: root
#     group: root
#     mode: '0644'
